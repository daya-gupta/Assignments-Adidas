Picture viewer is developed in a standalone html page.
It uses standalone React, ReactDOM and babel, and needs an internet connection to download them.

Also, As per my understanding 1 of the test case for calculator (mentioned below) is not valid. It gets failed with "eval" or any other mechanism, so it fails with my solution as well.
expect(calcString('+1'), 0);
